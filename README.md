## Data Set that interests me
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository

Potential data set: Iris - because it is one of the most common sets used for data science and I used it quite a bit for my courses,

but an alternative would be Wine - because I am interested in wine and would like to travel around the world and taste different wines and be able to identify them.

## Book that interests me
Introduction to R - Notes on R: A Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics - W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team - Beginner

URL: [https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf)

This book interests me because I studied R a bit in a certificate program for data mining and felt it was a lot easier to get the hang of than Jupyter Notebook which used Python for which I did take a course on but the syntax and programming was so different I felt lost while R felt more intuitive and the results showed up more. Also I'd like to get more skilled in both languages and feel that R would be quicker for me.
